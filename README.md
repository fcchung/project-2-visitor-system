The purpose of this application is to apply nodejs, express and vanilla javascript and perform simple operations on a database, MongoDB cloud in this case.

This app was build using the template from this demo: https://github.com/prsaya/node-express-mongodb-html-demo-1

This simple web application is made out of 2 html pages: the sign in page and the visitor system page

The sign in page contains 2 fields: user = Stephane and password = abc
